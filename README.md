# Candidate-Centric Election Forecasting Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting election outcomes using a bottom-up, candidate-centric approach.

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model that predicts election results by analyzing individual candidate characteristics and historical data. The model uses a bottom-up, candidate-centric approach to forecast electoral outcomes.

**Note**: This work is currently part of a journal article that has been submitted and is under review.

## What's Included
This repository contains:
- **Ex ante forecast analysis** (`ex-ante-forecast-2023.ipynb`) - Complete forecasting methodology and results
- **Training data** - Historical candidate and election data used for model development
- **Candidate information** - Comprehensive dataset of candidate characteristics
- **Data generation documentation** - Process documentation for data preparation

## Future Additions
